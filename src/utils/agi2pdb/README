AGI2PDB v0.0.1
by Stuart George <dfiber@mega-tokyo.com>

This program will convert AGI v2 and v3 games int a PalmOS DB format
which is more or less an 'v4' format for Sarien.

The internal header format inside the .pdb file is not finalised
and will change wildly over the comming months.

This is a preliminary alpha version.
