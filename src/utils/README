This package contains utilities to extract and convert data from
Sierra AGI resources. The utilities were originally released by Lance
Ewing as a set of hacks and are now being re-published in a single
package under the GNU General Public License.

Note: these utilities will look for AGI files in lower case.

The package currently contains showlog, volx and xv3. A brief summary
of each utility follows:

showlog
-------
showlog decodes Logic resources back to human-readable form. It
requires Logic resources previously extracted by volx or xv3

volx
----
Extract Logic, Sound, View and Picture resources from AGI files.
volx works only with AGI version 2 files.

xv3
---
Extract Logic, Sound, View and Picture resources from AGI files.
xv3 works only with AGI version 3 files.
