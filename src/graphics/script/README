This is the scriptable console driver. It's for debugging and test
purposes only, it has no graphics output and reads input from a text
file (a script) specified by the SARIEN_SCRIPT environment variable.
If this variable is not set, it will try to read a file called "script"
in the current directory.

See demo2.script for a sample script.
