ORAT
----
ORAT stands for "Ordinary Regression Tests" with an "A" thrown in
because ORAT sounds much better than ORT. It's a simple and portable
framework used for Sarien regression tests and is expected to run in every
platform where Sarien runs.

ORAT is organized on "test suites" comprised of "test modules" which
contains the actual tests.


Creating a test suite
---------------------


Writing test modules
--------------------
A test module is a collection of tests grouped by category or functionality
such as arithmetic commands, drawing or resource decoding. The module main
function is declared as TEST_MODULE(module_name) and contains declarations
in the form TEST(name, result). "name" is a free-form string and "result"
is an enumeration test_result, which contains TEST_OK, TEST_FAIL and
TEST_SKIP. 

A simple test module:

	#include "test.h"

	TEST_MODULE(example)
	{
		TEST("name", TEST_OK));
	}

Test modules are registered in a suite using the test_register_module
function.
