Quick notes - see docs/README.* for detailed information

Directories:

./VC++6.0		Visual C++ files
./docs			Documentation
./etc			Configuration files
./rulesets		Extra rulesets for different architectures
./src/core		AGI interpreter core files
./src/graphics		Graphic drivers
./src/sound		Sound drivers
./src/utils		Lance Ewing's AGI utilities

To build in UNIX platforms, run './configure; make'. ./configure --help
will show the build options. If you're using mingw32, go32 or djgpp, copy
the appropriate ruleset from rulesets/ to ./Rules. 

To build using VC++, check the files in the appropriate directory.

The code is currently under a cleanup/redesign process, in order to modularize
and remove global data mess. The graphics layer will probably need a rewrite.
Contact the maintainer (claudio@helllabs.org) to see how you can help.
