This is the original AGI Mouse 1.0 documentation from
From http://www.classicgaming.com/agisci/am-prgov.shtml

AGI Mouse is a third-party hack written by Brian Provinciano,
and conflicts with Sierra's official mouse support functions,
redefining command 171 (Sierra's command 171 is push.script and
is used in some AGI v3 games such as Manhunter.)

Support for AGI Mouse in sarien can be enabled using the
-m or --agimouse command line switch.

How to use the AGI Mouse 1.0 API

Introduction

AGI Mouse 1.0 gives AGI support for the mouse with extreme ease. This
document shows you how to make use of the AGI Mouse 1.0 API.

When I hacked the interpreter to give it mouse support, I removed the
existing unknown171 command, and replaced it with a routine I wrote to
poll the mouse status (x position, y position, button status). I call
this command from logic.000. Every interpreter loop executes logic.000,
thus polling the status. This way, you will need not worry about calling
the command every time you use the mouse status variables.

The unknown171 command returns the following variables...

v27	Button pressed (0=none, 1=left, 2=right, 3=middle) 
v28	The X position of the mouse
v29	The Y position of the mouse

You won't need to remember those numbers, because I edited defines.txt
to simplify things. The defines are as follows...

/***************************************************************************
 * AGI Mouse 1.0 defines
 ****************************************************************************/
#define mouse_button	v27	// The mouse button pressed 
#define mouse_x		v28	// Pixels from the left of the screen 
#define mouse_y		v29	// Pixels from the top of the screen 

#define mb_up		0	// Mouse button is up (not pressed) 
#define Mb_left		1	// Left mouse button 
#define Mb_right	2	// Right mouse button 
#define Mb_middle	3	// Middle mouse button

Important Things to Note

The mouse coordinates are not limited to playing area, they are returned
for the entire screen. As a result, if you are doing something such as
moving egothe the position that the mouse has clicked, you should subtract
8 (the amount of pixels the playing area is from the top of the screen)
from the mouse_y variable. I did this because it allows you to add a Lucas
Arts style Point and Click text buttons at the bottom of the screen (like
in The Secret of Money Island).

Ever since I added the code to hide/show the mouse cursor when text is
drawn on the screen, it's caused a lot of flickering. This is because if
you use a command such as display, and place it in your main execution
area, it draws the text every interpreter cycle (hiding and showing the
mouse cursor many times per second). Without this code, the mouse would
cause problems if it is in the area when the text is drawn.


How to Control Ego With the Mouse

To control the ego with the mouse, where you click, and the ego walks to
where you clicked, all you need to do is check to see if the mouse button
is pressed and then use the move.to.v command. Here's the code...

 if(mouse_button == Mb_left) { 
   mouse_y -= 8;	// remember, the play area is 8 pixels from
			// the top of the screen
   move.obj.v(ego, mouse_x, mouse_y, 2, f255); 
 }


How to Add a Button Control

To add a button control to your game is very easy. The following code
demonstrates a button with three states, mouse out, mouse over and mouse
down. It draws the view associated with object 2 (o2) accordingly. If
the button is pressed, it jumps to room 3.

 // Is mouse in the area of the button?
 if(mouse_y > 32 && mouse_y < 68 && mouse_x > 56 && mouse_x < 103) {
   // Is the mouse button pressed
   if(mouse_button == Mb_left) {
     // If it is, draw the mouse button down, then jump to room 3
     set.loop(o2,2);
     new.room(3);
   } else {
     // Otherwise, draw the button as a mouse over graphic
     set.loop(o2,1);
   }
 } else {
   // Draw the mouse button in normal state
   set.loop(o2,0);
 }
 draw(o2);

Subject: [sarien-devel] AGI Mouse clarification

I figured out what the problem with AGI Mouse support is. It turns out,
there are actually several different incarnations of AGI Mouse. AGI
Mouse 1.0 and higher use the API described in agimouse.txt. Older
versions (and I believe the new AGI Auto-Mouse) use a simpler,
backward-compatible system:

Moving the mouse a little bit in one direction (only eight ways) sets
the ego moving that way. Moving it slightly in that direction again
stops it (basically substitutes mouse mickeys for normal keyboard
control). The left mouse button acts as the Enter key, the right as
Escape, and the middle (if present) as F10. The original keys all work
though, allowing backward- and forward-compatibility.

The demo game is specially programmed to have the false ego move to the
ego's position when Esc is pressed in "walk" mode (enabled by default
or reactivated with the "walk" button) and have buttons along the top
activate when Esc/right-button is pressed with the ego on top of them.
The other buttons are senses, and trigger messages in different areas
of the screen when Esc/right-button is pressed, for example to describe
the door. The menu is reassigned to F10/middle-button to allow
Esc/right-button to be used for this. It's essentially an SCI interface
in AGI (but with cruder mouse support).

This interface may be useful to enable in Sierra games like Manhunter
II which use a similar cursor interface, only without native mouse support.
