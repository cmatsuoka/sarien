Things noted to be fixed

 - Finish the DJGPP/Allegro port (partially done)
 - Nicer save/load functions

SGEO:
 - PalmDB v4 driver needs to be cleaned up. Right now its an amalgam of
   agi_v2 + agi_v3.c source code. It's quite ugly. agi2pdb should do this
   kind of conversion for us.
 - AGI2PDB needs to convert a v3 game 'down' to v2 (ie: decompress it all)

Sound:
 - add the noise channel
 - add 8 bit sound driver
 - add DOS drivers

General:
 - Add error messages for unknown display and sound drivers, etc.

Graphics:
 - Drop root privileges when running svgalib binary and not
   initializing graphics
 - XFree86 DGA support
