Lots of things. Let's see...

0.4 sees a feature freeze until the next stable release, 0.6.0. All 0.4
releases until 0.6.0 will only be bugfixes of existing code, and new
features will be added to the unstable branch 0.5. That means you wont
see your inventory implemented until later on.

Things noted to be fixed
 - Much nicer menu code
 - Finish the DJGPP/Allegro port (partially done)
 - Finish the BeOS/SDL port
 - Get KQ4 working
 - Fix the......
 - Nicer save/load functions

SGEO:
 - PalmDB v4 driver needs to be cleaned up. Right now its an amalgen of agi_v2 + agi_v3.c
   source code. Its quite ugly. agi2pdb should do this kind of conversion for us.
 - AGI2PDB needs to convert a v3 game 'down' to v2 (ie: decompress it all)

Sound:
	- add the noise channel
	- add Solaris, *BSD, SGI, HP-UX drivers
	- add 8 bit sound driver
	- add DOS drivers (SB, GUS)

View:
	- Fix sprite management

General:
	- Implement restore
	- Implement inventory (partially done in 0.5.0)
	- Add error messages for unknown display and sound drivers, etc
	- Fix keyboard input (controller() opcode test)
	- Make cygwin cross-compiler work out of the box

Graphics:
	- Drop root privileges when running svgalib binary and not
	  initializing graphics
	- Add DGA support

CM:	Do Amiga/Atari/Mac AGI games emulate PC keyboard scancodes?
