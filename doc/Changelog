0.4.2.8 (19990401)
	- Added some games to the ID list
	  * Police Quest 1 (Apple ][gs Version) (known version 2.917)
	  * Kings Quest 1 (Apple ][gs Version)
		KQ1-PC v1.0S uses 2.272 so we make the assumtpion that
		KQ2-2GS v1.0S-88223 uses 2.272 also.
	  * Kings Quest 1 (Apple Macintosh Version)
		KQ1-PC v2.0F uses 2.425 (2.440) so we make the assumption
		that KQ2-MAC v2.0C uses (2.440)
	  * Space Quest 2 (Apple Macintosh Version) (known version 2.936)
	  * Black Cauldron (Apple ][gs Version) (very strange)
		This is a v3 AGI game using v2 AGI type version numbering.
		But it IS a v3 game so I have given it the equiv. id of the
		BC-PC game, the date (1989) clearly indicats v3 as well.
	  * Leisure Suit Larry 1 (Apple Mac Version) (known version 2.439)
	- Altered the DOS graphic driver to be in line with the X11 driver
	  by removing all "direct memory writes" and making it all buffered.

	  and used 1 _M_MSDOS macro for <conio.h> in include/includes.h

	  (bad stack again?)

0.4.2.7cm6 (19990331)

	  is being moved (fixes LSL opening and ego animation but breaks SQ2
	  credits -- something is still wrong)
	- Non-ego views won't cross control lines


0.4.2.7 (19990326)
	- Renamed "sound_dummy.c" to "snd_dmy.c" coz Watcom can't handle
	  long file names.
