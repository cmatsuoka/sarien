Notes on building Sarien using MPW
==================================

The supplied Sarien.make makefile uses SC and ILink to build a m68k
binary. Ideally it should produce fat binaries.

To build Sarien with MPW, use an utility like FileTyper to set
Sarien.make file type to "TEXT" and creator to "MPS ".

Oh yes, and this port is not complete yet. Notably it lacks sound
and graphics support.
